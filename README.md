The project involved predicting the stock prices of **Yes Bank** through a comprehensive data science approach, beginning with **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and trends in the data. Key stages included:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance. This included time-based features like day, month, and lagged values.
3. **Data Scaling**: Applied scaling techniques (Standardization/Normalization) to ensure uniformity across features.
4. **Insights Generation**: Explored relationships between various features and the stock price to gain insights into price movement factors.

After preparing the data, various **regression models** were implemented and evaluated:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **XGBoost Regression**

Each model was fine-tuned and compared based on key performance metrics to select the best-performing model for predicting Yes Bank's stock price.
